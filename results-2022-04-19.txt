uh  happy  east  denver  i'm  so  excited  to 
 be  back  this  is  my  fourth  east  denver 
 total  third  in  person  because  we  weren't 
 here  last  year  unfortunately  it's  super 
 great  to  see  the  community  and  we're 
 gonna  spend  the  next  20  minutes  or  so 
 going  deep  into  the  world  of  gas  fees 
 it's  going  to  be  a  bit  of  a  crash  course 
 i  move  very  very  quickly  to  try  to  cover 
 as  much  possible  um  but  i'm  here  with 
 you  for  this  reason 
 uh  boomers  and  ethereans  alike  like  to 
 compare  complain  about  gas  prices  right 
 and  it  never  seems  to  go  away  and  the 
 question  is  why  because  i  thought  we 
 were  supposed  to  fix  it  or  it's  going  to 
 get  fixed  in  the  future  we're  going  to 
 talk  today  about  how  they  work  and  why 
 they  work  and  what  we  can  expect  moving 
 forward  so  we're  going to  talk  about  the 
 past  present  and  future  of  gas  prices  so 
 prior  to  eip  1559  the  original  model  was 
 a  very  simple  first  price  auction 
 you  set  your  gas  price  the  miners 
 prioritize  the  highest  fees 
 there  was  a  fixed  block  size  with  a  15 
 million  gas  limit  didn't  didn't  change 
 and  the  miners  received  all  of  the  fees 
 at  the  end  of  it  super  straightforward 
 uh  it's  simple  and  you  had  one  variable 
 to  worry  about 
 very  easy  everybody  got  it 
 but  there  was  this  issue 
 where  trading  bots  and  other  systems 
 would  often  go  to  war  with  each  other 
 and  they  would  escalate  the  gas  price  to 
 win  a  certain  opportunity  and  this  would 
 bid  up  the  gas  price  of  the  entire 
 network  these  are  called  priority  gas 
 auctions  and  you  can  see  one  of  them 
 this  is  a  representative  one  here  um  if 
 the  gas  prices  for  the  network  are  low 
 the  bots  go  to  war  the  pga  happens  it 
 tabletops  and  then  it  sort  of  declines 
 and  if  you're  just  a  regular  user  doing 
 a  regular  thing  on  your  favorite  d5 
 protocol  or  your  favorite  nft  you 
 suffered  as  a  result  of  this  so  this  was 
 the  big  problem  with  this  original  fpa 
 model  where  it  was  super  difficult  to 
 figure  out  what  you  needed  to  do  to  get 
 into  the  next  gas  the  next  block  and  you 
 had  these  big  surges  okay  and  it  made 
 the  network  hard  to  use  and  people 
 complained  about  gas  prices  and  so  as  a 
 result 
 a  lot  of  research  went  into  what's  known 
 as  eip  1559  which  hopefully  all  of  you 
 are  familiar  with  that  significantly 
 changed  the  nature  of  the  gas  market  on 
 ethereum  okay 
 and  uh  this  was  launched  as  part  of  the 
 london  hard  fork  in  august  of  2021  we  at 
 block  native  were  very  involved  in  this 
 we  were  one  of  the  first  if  not  the 
 first  to  support  it  at  the  london  hard 
 fork  and  it  introduced  a  whole  series  of 
 changes  that  really  really  affects  the 
 way  that  the  network  works 
 first  we  now  have  dynamic  block  sizing 
 so  the  blocks  can  actually  change 
 dependent  on  demand 
 there's  three  variables  that  go  into 
 determining  gas  price  a  base  fee  a 
 priority  fee  also  called  the  minor  tip 
 and  what's  known  as  a  max  fee  which  is 
 super  disorienting  for  users 
 the  base  fee  is  the  minimum  inclusion 
 for  the  block  and  is  set  by  the  network 
 now  this  is  kind  of  a  major  change 
 because  prior  to  eip  1559  the  network 
 itself  was  not  aware 
 of  what  its  gas  fee  was  it  was  totally 
 set  externally  by  the  miners  and  so  the 
 network  actually  starts  to  become 
 self-aware  here  this  is  sort  of 
 interesting  in  its  implications  also  the 
 base  fee  must  be  paid  it  doesn't  matter 
 how  your  transaction  gets  into  the  block 
 you  could  be  a  miner  and  you  can  shove 
 it  in  there  through  a  private  network 
 you  still  got  to  pay  the  base  fee  and 
 the  base  fee  must  be  paid  in  eth  so  it 
 also  establishes  eth  as  the  core 
 currency  of  the  ethereum  network  which 
 strangely  enough  was  not  necessarily  the 
 case  up  until  eip  1559.  there's  a  lot 
 happening  here  the  base  fee  is  then 
 burned  so  the  network  charges  the  base 
 fee  and  it  goes  away  which  exerts 
 deflationary  pressure  on  the  circulation 
 of  eth  which  should  in  theory  increase 
 price  as  network  activity  increases  and 
 then  finally  the  priority  fee  which  is 
 set  by  the  user  is  paid  to  miners  so  you 
 have  these  two  variables  base  fee  set  by 
 the  network  priority  fee  set  by  the  uh 
 the  user 
 the  base  fee  gets  burned  the  priority 
 fee  goes  to  the  miner  got  it  it's  more 
 complicated  okay 
 now 
 uh  we  talked  about  paying  that  the  base 
 fee  has  an  algorithm 
 which  is  targeting  50 
 full  blocks  okay  so  the  variable  block 
 size  is  0  to  30  million  in  this  model 
 but  if  a  block  is  100 
 full 
 the  base  fee  will  increase  by  the 
 maximum  in  the  next  block  of  12  and  a 
 half  percent  so  block  to  block 
 the  most  that  the  base  fee  can  increase 
 is  twelve  and  a  half  percent  if  that 
 blocks  a  hundred  percent  full  it'll  go 
 up  by  twelve  percent  similarly 
 the  most  the  base  fee  can  be  reduced  in 
 between  blocks  is  minus  twelve  and  a 
 half  percent  but  it  only  does  that  with 
 a  zero  percent  full  block 
 empty  blocks  which  are  now  a  thing  with 
 miners  actually  mine  blocks  that  have  no 
 transactions  in  them  when  the  base  fee 
 goes  out  of  control  there's  no  demand 
 and  the  base  fee  uh  the  base  fee  goes 
 down  by  twelve  and  a  percent  blocks  are 
 empty  okay 
 when  you  set  your  priority  fee  you  will 
 always  be  charged  that  that  is 
 guaranteed  to  go  to  the  minor  it's 
 technically  optional  but  generally  it 
 needs  to  be  at  least  two  gray 
 and  you  set  this  max  fee 
 but  you're  almost  never  charged  the  max 
 fee  and  this  is  super  disorienting  for 
 users  because  they  put  this  number  in 
 that  says  the  maximum  amount  your 
 transaction  is  going  to  be  charged  but 
 that's  what  you're  authorizing  it's  sort 
 of  like  a  credit  limit  in  a  way  and  only 
 under  very  specific  network  conditions 
 will  your  max  fee  actually  go  into 
 effect 
 however  setting  the  max  fee  incorrectly 
 can  reduce  transaction  performance  and 
 predictability  so  this  max  fee  thing  is 
 a  little  bit  uh  confusing  the  big  risk 
 is  the  base  fee  is  the  minimum 
 price  you  set  for  inclusion  in  the  next 
 block  so  let's  say  the  base  fee  is  50 
 and  you're  like  great  i'm  going  to  price 
 my  transaction  at  50  but  before  your 
 transaction  can  get  included  the  base 
 fee  rises  to  55. 
 your  transaction  is  therefore 
 underpriced  and  is  not  a  candidate  for 
 inclusion  there's  no  way  your 
 transaction 
 can  get  into  a  block  until  the  base  fee 
 comes  back  down  to  the  50  that  you  set 
 it  at  so  what  you  want  to  do  is  set  a 
 max  fee  that  has  a  safety  factor  in  it 
 that  basically  can  account  for  hey  what 
 happens  if  the  base  fee  um  goes  up  so 
 this  whole  thing  about 
 max  fee  settings  a  little  bit  tricky  in 
 the  world  of  eip  1559  the  common 
 heuristic  is  your  max  fee  should  be 
 twice  your  base  fee  plus  your  priority 
 fee  with  the  idea  being  if  you  double 
 the  base  fee  you're  covered  for  the  next 
 six  blocks 
 because  at  a  maximum  rate  of  increase 
 the  base  fee  will  double  in  six  blocks 
 okay  but  what's  disorienting  for  the 
 user  is  now  the  transaction  looks  like 
 it's  going  to  be  super  expensive  and 
 then  the  transaction  gets  on  channel  we 
 don't  celebrate  to  say  hey  you  paid  way 
 less  than  your  max  fee  okay 
 so  we  work  with  folks  across  the 
 ecosystem  all  the  time  and  and  it's 
 interesting  how 
 persistently  confusion  on  what  the  maxi 
 actually  represents  when  it  comes  into 
 play  why  you  want  to  set  it  different 
 ways  is  actually  part  and  parcel  of 
 what's  going  on  so  i  really  encourage 
 everybody  to  get  familiar  with  these 
 concepts  as  part  of  the  current  network 
 with  eip1559 
 so  the  good  news  with  eip1559  is  we  have 
 variable  block  sizes  so  the  network  can 
 adapt  it's  much  easier  to  estimate 
 what's  going  to  happen  because  it's  not 
 supposed  to  move  around  so  much  and  we 
 have  this  deflationary  pressure  on  the 
 network  there  are  other  benefits  to  eip 
 1559  transactions  also  called  type  2 
 one 
 they  actually  tend  to  cost  less 
 if  you're  submitting  a  transaction 
 that's  type  0  the  old  model  on  average 
 you  pay  about  14  more  okay 
 now  do  users  care  about  overpaying  for 
 gas  absolutely  they  do  so  we  highly 
 encourage  whatever  you're  building  to  be 
 type  2  or  eip1559  compliant  so  that  your 
 users  don't  overpay  unnecessarily 
 two  an  unexpected  side  effect  is  type  2 
 transactions  tend  to  go  on  chain 
 slightly  faster  so  by  having  type  2 
 transactions  they  get  included  slightly 
 faster  than 
 type  0  transactions  so  another  benefit 
 of  being  eip  1559  compliant 
 now  however  in  the  wild  these  factors 
 interplay  with  each  other  in  interesting 
 and  unexpected  ways  and  so  this  is  some 
 real  world  data  from  an  nft  launch 
 galaxy  eggs  on  uh  september  14th  of  2021 
 and  and  here's  what  the  base  feed  did 
 during  this  galaxy  eggs  nft  launch  so 
 the  nft  launches  everybody's  super 
 excited  surge  of  transactions  in  the 
 network  and  we  can  see  the  base  fee  is 
 going  up  we  have  full  blocks  at  the  12.5 
 percent  rate  up  up  up  up up  up  up  up  and 
 then  it  gets  to  about 
 2500  gray  kind  of  tabletops  and  then  it 
 descends  down  okay  nice  smooth 
 algorithmic  and  predictable 
 but  remember 
 under  eip  1559  there  are  two  factors 
 which  you  have  to 
 include  you  have  your  base  fee  and  your 
 priority  fee  what  was  going  on  with  the 
 priority  fee 
 oh 
 oh  interesting  so 
 basically  we  saw  this  huge  surge  in  the 
 minimum  priority  feed  minimum  in  the 
 block  the  bottom  of  the  block  right 
 these  big  jumps  that's  2  000  gray 
 and  the  time  here  is  sort  of  set  to  the 
 beginning  if  i  overlay  these  two  look  at 
 this  when  the  base  fee  is  low  the 
 priority  fee  goes  high 
 and  as  the  base  fee  increases  the 
 priority  fee  declines  they  interact  with 
 each  other  there's  actually  an  algorithm 
 at  play  here  the  algorithm  of  eip1559 
 and  there's  the  psychology  of  the  users 
 who  are  trying  to  participate  in  the  nft 
 drop  and  these  two  combine  to  look  like 
 this  this  was  the  actual  network 
 conditions  during  this  drop 
 and  if  we  combine  them 
 what  does  that  look  like  it's  the  exact 
 same  table  top  we  had  before 
 rapid  rise  flat  across  the  top  and  a 
 decline  so  even  under  eip  1559  priority 
 gas  auctions  are  still  a  thing 
 they  just  have  more  variables  they're  a 
 little  less  likely  to  occur 
 but  we  must  pay  attention  to  what's 
 going  on  with  the  network  we  must  be 
 aware  that  there  can  be  sudden  changes 
 in  the  conditions  to  get  transactions 
 included  and  that  the  psychology  and 
 these  algorithms  interact  in  ways  that 
 are  often  not  obvious  okay  and  this  is 
 probably  the  most  important  element  that 
 we  pay  attention  to  when  it  comes  to 
 predicting  gas  fees  is  it's  pretty  easy 
 to  predict  the  algorithms  it's 
 incredibly  hard  to  predict  the 
 psychology  okay 
 and  what's  coming 
 so  there's  some  cons  here  there's  some 
 changes  coming  with  the  merge  that  we 
 believe  will  change  some  of  the 
 psychology  and  this  psychology  changes 
 will  therefore  have  impacts  on  the  state 
 of  the  gas  marketplace 
 so  oh  uh  here's  another  interesting 
 thing  that  today 
 even  after  all  this  time  of  eip1559 
 being  on  mainnet  still  only  75  percent 
 of  transactions  are  type  2.  so  fully  25 
 of  transactions  on  ethereum  are 
 overpaying  by  about  14  on  average 
 they're  getting  included  slower  the 
 network  has  to  do  more  work  so  we  still 
 have  work  to  do  to  drive  adoption  of 
 type  2  and  make  eip1559 
 completely  uh  transparent  through  the 
 whole  network 
 you  guys  with  me  so  far  i  told  you  this 
 is  going  to be  a  crash  course  right  so 
 we  went  through 
 uh  the  beginning  of  where  we  started 
 fpas 
 first  price  auction  and  that  turned  into 
 pga  priority  gas  auction  we  reboot  the 
 model  we  moved  to  eip1559 
 we  now  have  three  variables  at  play  how 
 those  variables  get  expressed  and  which 
 actually  get  charged  become  a  lot  less 
 clear 
 so  the 
 eip1559  is  more  efficient 
 it's  more  predictable  but  it's  harder  to 
 understand  okay 
 so  as  we  look  ahead 
 what's  coming  next  is  the  merge 
 so  what's  going  to  change  with  gas  fees 
 during  the  merge 
 so 
 estimate  mid  this  year  coming  up  pretty 
 quick 
 ethereum  mainnet  will  merge  with  the 
 beacon  chain 
 and  you  know  what 
 almost  nothing  changes 
 that  we  still  have  dynamic  block  sizing 
 we  still  have  base  feed  priority  max  fee 
 but  instead  of  a  minor  tip  it  now 
 becomes  a  validator  tip  okay 
 we  still  have  the  base  fee  set  by  the 
 network  priority  fee  set  by  users  it's 
 still  burned  and  the  validators  are 
 going  to  receive  the  priority  fee  now 
 the  uh  i  won't  go  too  far  into  this  but 
 the  validator  model  and  the  deflationary 
 pressure  should  increase 
 as  a  result  of  the  merge  so  the  good 
 news  is  once  you  learn  eip1559 
 you're  gonna  be  well  prepared  for  what's 
 coming  with  the  merge 
 however 
 there's  this  change  and  this  change  is 
 very  subtle 
 but  we  think  this  change  is  going  to  be 
 worth  paying  attention  to  and  it  takes  a 
 little  explaining  and  this  change  is 
 known  as  fixed  block  times 
 so  today  under  the  current  system  proof 
 of  work 
 you  have  variable  block  times  the 
 network 
 targets  about  13  and  a half  seconds  per 
 block  on  average  but  we  all  know  a  block 
 can  be  confirmed  in  one  second  or  60 
 seconds 
 that  there's  actually  no  way  to  know 
 when  the  next  block  is  going  to  be 
 confirmed  okay  it's  completely 
 unknowable  and  so  therefore  if  you're 
 trying  to  get  into  the  next  block 
 you  don't  know  when  the  block  is  going 
 to  happen  so  every  millisecond  is 
 equally  valuable  as  the  next  millisecond 
 because  everyone's  trying  to  get  on  the 
 next  block  nobody  knows  when  that  block 
 is  going  to  get  confirmed 
 and 
 everybody  competes  equally  through  a 
 consistent  time  horizon  okay 
 that  time  is  basically  flat  and  linear 
 and  transactions  flowing  into  the 
 transaction  pool  or  the  mempool  are  can 
 happen  at  any  time 
 but  there's  this  subtle  change  which  is 
 coming  with  the  merge  and  under  proof  of 
 stake 
 blocks  will  be  confirmed  every  12 
 seconds 
 like  clockwork 
 and  so  what  does  that  mean 
 that  means  not  all  milliseconds  are 
 equal  anymore 
 because  if  i'm  trying  to  get  something 
 on  a  ch  on  chain  and  i  want  to  make  sure 
 i  get  it  and  someone  doesn't  beat  me  to 
 it 
 when  am  i  going  to  transmit  my 
 transaction 
 and  i'm  going  to  transmit  my  transaction 
 in  the  first  second 
 after  the  block  was  confirmed  or  am  i 
 going  to  wait 
 to  2nd  11th  maybe 
 second  11  and  a  half 
 so  when  i  transmit  the  transaction  all 
 my  competitors  out  there  have  a  smaller 
 time  window  to  respond 
 and  so  what's  significant  here 
 is  this  will  impact  intra  block 
 transaction  velocity  okay  today  in  the 
 current  proof  of  work  model  we  have  a 
 constant  velocity 
 all  milliseconds  are  equal  as  we  move  to 
 proof-of-stake  as  we  move  to  fix  block 
 times  we  will  have  this  surge  effect 
 where  the  second  or  two  before  the  block 
 gets  confirmed  more  transactions  will 
 flood  into  the  pool  there'll  be  tighter 
 time  horizons  for  various  automated 
 systems  to  compete  with  each  other 
 there'll  be  a  rush  to  lower  and  lower 
 latency  infrastructure  in  order  to 
 detect  and  respond 
 and  we  believe  that  this  will  have 
 an  impact  on  gas  fees 
 right 
 because  the  nature  of  transactions 
 flowing  in  and  out  will  be  different  but 
 the  question  is 
 what  change 
 what's  going  to  happen  and  the  answer  is 
 nobody  knows  yet  right  there  are 
 researchers  who  are  working  on  this  and 
 what  we're  going  to  have  to  do  is  look 
 at  this  theory  and  compare  it  to  the 
 reality  okay  that  what  we  saw  with  the 
 launch  of  eip1559  was  a  bunch  of  new 
 behavior  we  hadn't  seen  before  like  the 
 interaction  and  interplay  between  the 
 priority  fee  and  the  base  fee  under 
 periods  of  rapid  congestion  and  i 
 believe  we  believe  at  block  native  we 
 will  see  some  similar  new  phenomena  uh 
 post  merge 
 that  will  affect  the  entire  network  and 
 the  nature  of  the  gas  fee  marketplace  so 
 this  is  super  fun  this  is  super 
 interesting  and  it  is  super  meaningful 
 oh  there's  another  thing  looking  past 
 the  merge  where  we  look  towards  um 
 sharding  which  will  increase  block  space 
 and  we  have  a  hint  of  what  might  happen 
 here  by  looking  at  l2  and  sidechain 
 smart  contract  transaction  volumes  so 
 this  chart  real  quick  it  shows  the  blue 
 is  smart  contract  transactions  and  the 
 um 
 orange  is  just  simple  transfer 
 transactions  on  ethereum  mainnet 
 this  line  is  the  polygon  side  chain 
 simple  transactions  just  simple 
 transfers 
 and  this  is  polygon  sidechain  smart 
 contract  transactions  so  where  we  have 
 polygon  sidechain  where  we  have  more  uh 
 reduced  gas  fees  where  we  have  more 
 block  space  theoretically  what  we  see  is 
 significantly  more  smart  contract 
 transaction  volume  so  as  we  look  ahead 
 to  sharding  which  will  be  2023  time 
 horizon 
 we  may  see  massive  increases  in  overall 
 smart  contract  transaction  volume  so 
 there's  this  thing  that  happens  which  is 
 look  if  we  just  had  enough  block  space 
 the  gas  prices  would  go  down  it's  sort 
 of  like  saying  if  we  just  had  enough 
 highways  there  would  be  no  traffic  right 
 it  turns  out  that  as  you  add  highways 
 you  add  traffic  because  more  people  will 
 travel  and  so  similarly  as  we  look  to 
 add  block  space  there's  this  going  to  be 
 corresponding  increase  in  demand  for 
 that  block  space  and  this  will  still 
 matter  so  are  we  going  to  be  talking 
 about  gas  fees  next  year  probably  are  we 
 going  to  be  talking  about  gas  fees  after 
 that 
 probably  are  we  going  to  be  talking 
 about  gas  fees  10  years  in  the  future 
 probably  why  because  block  space  is 
 valuable 
 and  so  in  the  past  gas  fees  mattered 
 in  the  present  right  now  gas  fees  matter 
 and  in  the  future  gas  fees  are  going  to 
 matter  so  we  all  have  to  pay  attention 
 to  that  so  this  meme  isn't  going  to 
 change  we're  all  going  to  still  be 
 talking  about  this  and  and  what  we  need 
 is  continued  research  and  we  invite 
 people  in  um  we  at  block  native  publish 
 real-time  data  on  the  state  of  the  gas 
 marketplace  we  encourage  you  to  check 
 that  out  and  incorporate  that  find  new 
 things  look  through  historic  blocks 
 there's  tons  of  interesting  stuff 
 happening  here 
 we  believe  we  can  improve  the  user 
 experience  so  users  have  a  better  idea 
 of  what  they  can  expect  for  what  their 
 transactions  are  going  to  cost  where 
 they  should  put  transactions  on  a  side 
 chain  or  l2  to  have  less  and and  what 
 the  outcomes  are  going  to  be  and  that 
 fundamentally  with  more  capable 
 infrastructure  we  can  improve  the 
 transaction  experience  across  the  board 
 and  as  we  do  so  we're  here  to  help  check 
 out  our  gas  estimator  check  out  our  gas 
 api  we're  block  data.com  and  this  has 
 been  super  fun  i'm  matt  cutler  really 
 appreciate  your  time  and  attention  and 
 please  have  a  great  rest  of  east  denver 
 okay  thanks  everybody 
 [Applause] 
 that  was  amazing  thank  you  thank  you
